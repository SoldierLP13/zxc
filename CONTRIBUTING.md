# contributing

You should change the file `data/docs.yml` if you want to contribute documentation.
Please provide descriptions and examples!

Clarify the purpose of a parameter in a function if it is not obvious enough.
The function/constant/hook signature should NOT have names, but rather types (this goes for the return field too...)
You should name the parameters in the **description** if it is not obvious enough, like described above.

# markdown support

`description` and `example` fields support Markdown.
Please properly fence your example code in code blocks. Look around `data/docs.yml` for an example.
